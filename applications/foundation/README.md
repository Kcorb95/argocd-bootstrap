## Foundation ApplicationSet Metadata

All files in this directory are metadata for installing applications as part of the [foundation-appset.yaml](/manifests/appsets/foundation-appset.yaml) 

As a result they all require providing the same set of keys defined in [foundation-appset.yaml](/manifests/appsets/foundation-appset.yaml)
